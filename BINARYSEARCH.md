#Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm used to find the position of or search a specific element in an array. Painter partition problem is a problem that involves binary search concept.Herein we need to find the minimum number of painters that will paint given number of boards.

###maxinarray(): finds the maximum element in the array(Note: this will act as the start position of binary search).

###sumofallarrayelements(): finds the sum of all array elements.(Note: this will act as the end position of binary search).

###isVALID():this will check if our given element(in between the start and end position) satisfies the given condition or not.
